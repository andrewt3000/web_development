# Web Development
These are notes on building the image trainer web app. It discusses libraries choosen and why. It also gives example code and preferences among options within the libraries.   

The app consists of a [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)  [single page app (spa)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) and a [rest api](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) for the back end.   
This app is targeted to desktop computers and not mobile.  

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  

I use ncu to keep javascript packages up to date.  ncu command show what needs to be updated. ncu -u updates the package.json file. 

### Source Control
Code is tracked using git.  
[git reference](https://git-scm.com/docs)  
[git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)  
I am planning to do continuous integration. Pushing to master will publish.  

### React  
[Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)    
[create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)  

I prefer to use functional rather than class [components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html). I also prefer to use [state hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) and [effect hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) rather than [state and lifecyle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)     

### React componet libraries:  
[antd](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) - desktop oriented react ui components. used by alibaba.   
[styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/) - is popular react library for styling custom components. It should be used for any custom components.   

Alternatives:  
These are alternative libraries that were considered and should be reconsidered if we need a component that is not available. 
[react bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)  
[material UI](https://material-ui.com/)  

### State Management   
[mobx](https://mobx.js.org/intro/overview.html) - state managment. This was chosen over [redux](https://redux.js.org/) becuase it has less boilerplate.    

Use inject when you need to access state variables. Use observer to react to state variables.  
We are not using the decorators.  

```javascript
import { inject, observer } from "mobx-react"
props.appState.cameraID
export default inject("appState")(observer(CameraSelect))
```

### React Router
[react router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy)  App uses BrowserRouter which uses history api.

There is a page that routes urls to react components. Use the Link object to link to urls.   
```javascript
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";
<Route path="/image" exact component={Image} />
<Link to="/camera">Cameras</Link>
```

Use the history object to redirect to a route. This comes from createBrowserHistory.  
```javascript
history.push('/myroute')
````

### Socket io
[socket.io](https://socket.io) is prefered for real time notifications to browser.  

### Browser error logging
Using a browser error logging service such as [sentry](https://sentry.io/) helps alert to production problems.  

### front end testing
Jest (bundled with create react app) is test runner, assertion library, and mocking library.  
Enzyme is used for assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Componentsâ€™ output.  

## Authentication and Authorization
I prefer using [jwt](https://jwt.io/) over server side state management because it consumes resources on the servers and it is easier to load balance accross multiple servers. 

JWT has 3 parts: header, payload, and signature. Payload contains session fields such as user name, user privileges, company_id etc. 

If the user login is successful it returns a jwt token to the client. The token is stored in localStorage and have a function to add the jtw token to all ajax requests in authorization header as Bearer {token}. The node api has [middleware](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) that filter routes. If authenticated, add info to request and call next middleware. Otherwise, api responds with 401.   

I considered using identity as a service providers such as [auth0](https://auth0.com/), and [Amazon cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) because you don't have to store and protect sensitive information including user's passwords, and your jwt secret key.  


### Node  
I chose node because I am a full stack developer and prefer to work in javascript.  

I prefer Express for routing.  
Guide: [Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) [Using Middleware](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)  
[4.X API](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)  
Node contains objects: express, request, response and router.  
Commonly used: app.use(), router.route(), req.params, req.body    

Alternatives:  
[graphql](https://graphql.org/) - I chose not to use graphql because we have more full stack developers rather than a front end team and a backend team.     

Using serverless is an archticture that I am still considering and may move towards replacing express.  
[serverless](https://serverless.com/)   

### Mongo DB
I am using mongo db due to large number of records stored.  
[Mongo node driver](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/contents.html)  
I am considering using [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) for an ORM.  
[Mongo Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) - gui for mongo

### Deployment
I am using Azure blob storage for images and considering Azure App Services to host the node app.
