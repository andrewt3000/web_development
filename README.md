# Web Development
These are notes on several web apps that I have built and maintain. It lists tools, alternatives, and opinions.   

The apps consists of a [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) / [react](https://reactjs.org/) /  [single page app (spa)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) and a [Node](https://nodejs.org) / [rest api](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) for the back end.   


Language Alternatives:  
[typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (a superset of javascript) has type checking support.  
[flow](https://flow.org/) - a javascript static type checker.  
 

### IDE, text editors
Preferred: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [vi](https://www.vim.org/)     
Alternative: [Atom](https://atom.io/), [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)  

### Source Control
Preferred: [git](https://git-scm.com/) ([command ref](https://git-scm.com/docs)  ) - open source, distributed [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)     
[git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)  

Alternative: git obsoletes other open source vcs such as rcs, cvs, and subversion.  

### Source control hosting
Preferred: [github](https://github.com/)  
Alternatives: [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)  

### Version control workflow
Best practice: Source control work flow with multiple developers and an architects is:  
- Devs work on feature branches. 
- When the feature is complete devs merged and push to a dev branch, and they do a PR ([pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)) 
- Architect/manager approves PR after testing.   
- Pushing to master automatically deploys to live production. 


### App Versioning  
Preferred: [semantic verisioning](https://semver.org/)   
I also plan to track an app version number in the package.json file and reflect that number to users to make sure they have the latest version. 

Keeping users on the latest version has been a challenge. Cache busting is built into the build process. However CRA defaults the app to be a [Service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/) which I believe is presenting problems. Currently users have to refresh the app, then close the browser to get the latest version.   

### Package manager
Preferred: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)  - npm is a cli package manager and task runner. They also host a public package repository.    
Alternatives: [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)  

### Updating packages
best practice: keep javascript packages up to date on front and back end.  
```
#command show what needs to be updated
ncu 

#updates the package.json file. 
ncu -u 
```

# Front end web development

### React  
[Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) ([docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  
[chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)  
[create react app](https://create-react-app.dev/) ([src](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) ([docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)) - cli to generate new react app. CRA configures [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), a js module bundler.   
CRA depends on react-scripts which should be [updated](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/updating-to-new-releases). We have not and do not plan to [eject](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject)      

Preference: I generally prefer to use functional rather than class [components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) and to use [state hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) and [effect hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) rather than [state and lifecyle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)     

Alternatives: [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) ([vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) [nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/))   

### React componet libraries:  
Most of my apps are targeted to desktop computers and not mobile, although they are mostly [responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design).  

Preferred:  
[antd](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) - Desktop oriented react ui components. It is used by several chinese companies including alibaba, tencent and Baidu.   
[styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/) - is a popular react library for styling custom components.  

Alternatives:  
- [react bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)  
- [material UI](https://material-ui.com/) - created by google  
- [blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/)  
- [element](https://element.eleme.io)  
- [semantic ui](https://semantic-ui.com/)  

### State Management   
Preferred: [mobx](https://mobx.js.org/intro/overview.html) - simple, scalable, state management.  
[mobx-react](https://mobx-react.js.org/)  

Alternatives:  
- [redux](https://redux.js.org/) A Predictable State Container for JS Apps. Has immutable state. It has more boilerplate than mobx, [redux tradeoffs](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367). Redux is  commonly used with [Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) and [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) bindings. Typically use involves [thunks](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk#redux-thunk) or [sagas](https://redux-saga.js.org/) for [middleware](https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware).  
[redux chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)  

Considering: [immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction) - work with immutable state in a more convenient way. Can be used to simplify redux or mobx reducers.    

The [gist of mobx](https://mobx.js.org/intro/overview.html) is:
1. Define state and make it [observable](https://mobx.js.org/refguide/observable.html).  
2. Create a view that responds to changes in the State. (by making it a mobx-react [observer](https://mobx-react.js.org/observe-how)  
3. Modify the State  (either through direct mutation or through an [action](https://mobx.js.org/refguide/action.html))  

Best practice: Currently using mobx-react inject when you need to access state variables via props (going forward [reconsider due to changes](https://mobx-react.js.org/recipes-inject)).  
Best practice: Have considered using the decorators, but not currently using them due to not being [stable supported language feature](https://mobx.js.org/best/decorators.html).  

```javascript
import { inject, observer } from "mobx-react"
props.appState.cameraID
export default inject("appState")(observer(CameraSelect))
```

### React Router
[react router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy) is a declarative react routing framework.


There is a page that routes urls to react components. Use the Link object to link to urls.   
```javascript
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";
<Route path="/image" exact component={Image} />
<Link to="/camera">Cameras</Link>

//to read route parameters
props.match.params.myParam
```

Use the history object to redirect to a route. This comes from createBrowserHistory.  
```javascript
history.push('/myroute')
````
### Data fetching
[fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API#Concepts_and_usage) is a web api (natively supported in more recent browsers).  
best practice: If supporting older browsers use a [polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill) such as [isomorphic-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isomorphic-fetch) or [fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch).  

alternative: [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)  

### Browser error logging
Using a browser error logging service such as [sentry](https://sentry.io/) helps alert to production problems.  

### Front end unit testing
Jest - test runner, assertion library, and mocking library.  
[snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing) is a feature that I use.  
Jest expects tests to be in a folder named \_\_tests__ or to be named file_name.test.js  
```
#to run tests
npm test
```

#### Dom manipulation, and assertion libraries
- [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) is used for assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Componentsâ€™ output. It mimicks jQuery api.  
- [react testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) is an alternative to enzyme for dom manipulation and traversal. Written by Kent C. Dodds.    

### End to End Testing
- [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)  
- [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) Headless Chrome Node.js API  

# Server Side
### Node  
An advantage of node for full stack developers is using the same language on front and back end.  

I prefer Express for routing. 
To get started use [Express application generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html)  
Guide: [Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) [Using Middleware](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)  Middleware, in the context of express, is code between receiving a request and producing a response.  
[4.X API](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)  
Node contains objects: express, request, response and router.  
Commonly used: app.use(), router.route(), req.params, req.body    

Alternatives Node rest APIs:  
- [hapi](https://hapi.dev/) - node api that doesn't use middleware. Express is designed for server side rendering, not rest apis.    

- [graphql](https://graphql.org/) - is an alternative to rest apis. GraphQL is a specification for a typed query language similar to sql and runtime which incluces a client (eg. relay, apollo) and server. [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) is a popular graphql implementation. [Relay](https://relay.dev/) is a popular graphql client.     
- [serverless](https://serverless.com/) is a framework that can route to serverless cloud functions such as AWS lambda. Serverless cloud functions can be implemented in a variety of languages.     

# Databases
There are 2 classes of databases: relational (which typically use SQL) and NoSql which include Wide column stores, document stores, key-value stores, and graph databases.  

best practice: [database normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization)  

### MS Sql Server
I use MS Sql Server on several projects are suited to relational databases.   
[tediousjs](https://github.com/tediousjs/node-mssql) MS Sql node driver.  
- [Sql Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) - MS Windows client.  
- [SQLPro for MSSQL](https://www.macsqlclient.com/) mac client (room for improvement)  

### Mongo DB
I am using mongo db on some project due to large number of records stored.  
[Mongo node driver](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/contents.html)  
I am considering using [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) for an ORM. One advantage is versioning system that helps resolve update conflicts.    
[Mongo Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) - gui for mongo

# Application Logic

### Authentication and Authorization
I prefer using [jwt](https://jwt.io/) over server side state management because it consumes less resources on the servers and it is easier to load balance accross multiple servers. 

JWT has 3 parts: header, payload, and signature. Payload contains session fields such as user name, user privileges, company_id etc. 

If the user login is successful it returns a jwt token to the client. The token is stored in localStorage and have a function to add the jtw token to all ajax requests in authorization header as Bearer {token}. The node api has [middleware](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) that filter routes. If authenticated, add info to request and call next middleware. Otherwise, api responds with 401. 

On the client side I wrap react router's Route object with logic to redirect if the user isn't logged in [Example](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/auth-workflow). I track if the user's login status in mobx. Client side authentication is for convenience, the pages without data are not secure assets.   

I considered using identity as a service providers because you don't have to store and protect sensitive information including user's passwords, and your jwt secret key.  
- [auth0](https://auth0.com/)
- [okta](https://www.okta.com/)  
- [Amazon cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/)   


# Dev Ops

### Current Deployment
Azure blob storage for images.  
Azure App Services to host the app. (node and front end)  
Database is hosted on [mongo db atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com).  

In production, the front end is served through node. This avoids cors issues because everything is served from the same domain.  

In dev, "npm start" starts web on port 3000, and node on port 4001. There is a proxy in web package.json to port 4001 , which avoids cors issues in dev also. [See Create React app documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development)   

### Under Consideration  
#### serverless architectures 
The upside to serverless is scalability. The downside is propreitary apis and lack of control of the environment. For instance, an issue I had with serverless was aws lambda was on an older version of node than what I was using.   

[Azure functions](azure_functions.md) - serverless functions use http triggers and binding to do routing.  

AWS [Cloud Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) / API Gateway / lambda / Lambda authorizers.  

[vercel (formerly zeit) now](https://vercel.com/home) - Used previously.  cli (now), now.json config file, but routes default to file system layout.  
host static site and [serverless functions](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction/) (use now api for routing instead of express etc.).  
Integrates with github etc.    

#### Cloud agnostic Frameworks  
One solution to vendor lockin is to use another 3rd party.  
[serverless](https://serverless.com/) - cli (serverless) + yaml config file w/ routes (serverless.yml). supports aws, azure, google cloud etc.   

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - cli. teraform configuration language. infrastructure as code i.e. much larger in scope than serverless. Cloud agnostic (aws/azure/google etc.)
